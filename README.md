# Climate EDA
[Data source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyaladi/climate-insights-dataset)  
Exploratory data analysis over climate change dataset. Columns description can be found inside data folder. The data covers worldwide climate features such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc.  
## Methodology
ETL process is implmented here. First, some simple extracting as I already downloaded the data from Kaggle. Perform transformation on data such as deriving date and adding continent column by mapping countries. Loading the data into csv after cleaning and transforming. Then visualise the data using seaborn and interactive visualisation using Power BI (although it is only available in pdf unless you download the power BI file).
